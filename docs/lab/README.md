# Lab

***WIP: This is an evolving section as I iron out the details***

This section outlines how I've set up my Homelab.

Most everything is done from my development laptop running Fedora 35
Workstation[^1] and most host operating systems are running distributions based
on Red Hat products (XCP-ng[^2] and Fedora CoreOS[^3]), so things like package
management are done with DNF/YUM, and SELinux is taken into account where
applicable.

If you to use this as a guide but want to use a different distribution, then you
will have to figure out how to translate that to your chosen platform.

Entries are numbered and ordered how they are implemented.
