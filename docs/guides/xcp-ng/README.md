# XCP-ng

[XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/) is a fork of [Citrix&reg; Hypervisor (formerly XenServer&reg;)](https://xenserver.org/) spurred on by licensing changes to XenServer&reg; [in late 2017](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/12/12/xenserver-7-3-changes-to-the-free-edition/) that made the free version fairly useless for any reasonable use, especially in a homelab.

Based on the [Xen Project](https://xenproject.org/), which has been in use since 2003, it's very stable and performant. Xen is a little quirky to use if you've come from other hypervisors ([ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html)/VMware, or [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/)) and really benefits from management tooling, but once evrything is set up it's golden.
