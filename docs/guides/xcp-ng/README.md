# XCP-ng

XCP-ng[^1] is a fork of Citrix&reg; Hypervisor[^2]
(formerly XenServer&reg;[^3]) spurred on by licensing changes to
XenServer&reg;[^3] in late 2017[^4] that made the free version fairly useless
for any reasonable use, especially in a homelab.

Based on the Xen Project[^5], which has been in use since
2003, it's very stable and performant. Xen is a little quirky to use if you've
come from other hypervisors (ESXi/VMware[^6], or KVM[^7]) and really benefits
from management tooling, but once evrything is set up it's golden.
