# Guides

*Guide* is a loose term.

[Services](./services/) document how I've set up these things in my own Homelab, so they're often tailored for my specific environment and preferences. If there are alternative ways to do something, I try to link to them. [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) is my go-to Linux distribution, so most guides are written using that.

[XCP-ng](./xcp-ng/) is a collection of things useful for running and managing [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/) servers. These are what I use in my homelab, and I think it's a great platform and free alternative to some of the other popular (and expensive) type 1 hypervisors.

Other stand-alone articles are just tidbits of information that I've found useful at one point or another.
