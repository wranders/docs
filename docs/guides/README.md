# Guides

*Guide* is a loose term.

[Services](./services/) document how I've set up these things in my own Homelab, so they're often tailored for my specific environment and preferences. If there are alternative ways to do something, I try to link to them.

Other stand-alone articles are just tidbits of information that I've found useful at one point or another.
