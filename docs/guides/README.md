# Guides

*Guide* is a loose term.

<!-- [Services](./services/) document how I've set up these things in my own Homelab,
so they're often tailored for my specific environment and preferences. If there
are alternative ways to do something, I try to link to them.
[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) is my go-to Linux distribution, so most guides
are written using that. -->

[WSL](./wsl/) is a collection of configurations useful when using WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux).

[XCP-ng](./xcp-ng/) is a collection of things useful for running and managing
[XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/) servers.

Other stand-alone articles are just tidbits of information that I've found
useful at one point or another.
